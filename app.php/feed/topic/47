Hello everyone,<br>MrKoronas, Eckie, Pronixx and I have been discussing about what we could comunicate during the training session. So far we have come up with this program.<br>If I put it up here, that's because I would advise you to go over it, as almost all the topics are quickly explained. This way, if you missed a training session, you can still look at this and gather some information.<br>The "General awareness" and "Planetside reflexes" chapters are especially made for less experienced players, or just players that didn't bother looking more in depth into the game. By reading these chapters, you could get an information you didn't already know, wich would improve your survivability and overall effectiveness.<br><br>So here it is :<br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline">1) In-game voice</span><br>  <strong class="text-strong">a) Correct voice settings</strong><br>    i) Esc -&gt; SETTINGS -&gt; AUDIO &amp; VOICE -&gt; "Master Receive Volume" to 70, "Transmit volume" to 50, "Ducking" to 50<br>    ii) Ducking settings (reduces sounds when someone is talking, In game, Not TS) -&gt; "Ducking" to 50<br>  <strong class="text-strong">b) Hotkeys set-up to mute TS when talking ingame (talk to Kyle)</strong><br><span style="text-decoration:underline"><br>2) Communication</span><br>  <strong class="text-strong">a) Squad name and number</strong><br>    i) Alpha One or A1 in squad or platoon chat<br>  <strong class="text-strong">b) Spawning vehicle</strong><br>    i) Alpha Galaxy Up/Spawned<br> <strong class="text-strong"> c) Difference between a request and an order</strong><br>    i) Who can pull a galaxy for Alpha?<br>    ii) Alpha three pull a galaxy<br>  <strong class="text-strong">d) Kill confirmation</strong><br>    i) Sunderer at platoon waypoint down<br>    ii) Sunderer on orange smoke down<br> <strong class="text-strong"> e) Calling enemy position</strong><br>    i) North/South/East/West<br>    ii) Building position Small stairs/Big stairs/Balcony/Tunnels<br>    iii) If you die in a building call out rough numbers and class’s<br>    iv) Enemy sunderer between A and B point<br> <strong class="text-strong"> f) Knowing building terminology</strong><br>    i) Small Stairs<br>    ii) Big stairs<br>    iii) Banana building<br>    iv) Double doors<br>    v) Top/bottom/Roof<br>    vi) Tunnels<br>  <strong class="text-strong">g) Reconfirm orders in case of misunderstanding</strong><br>    i) Copy/Roger/understood &lt;- That you received clearly the instructions<br>    ii) Asking again what you should be doing if you don’t know/understand<br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline">3) Redeploying</span><br>  <strong class="text-strong">a) Most important key in the game</strong><br>    i) U key<br>  <strong class="text-strong">b) Why is it so important?</strong><br>    i) Allows the squad/platoon to be responsive<br>    ii) Makes winning a battle easier<br>    iii) Squad leads can focus on the next objective<br>  <strong class="text-strong">c) What to do when a redeploy is called?</strong><br>    i) Press the U key regardless of what's going on right now.<br>    ii) If unsafe then run towards the enemy and spray and pray until you die<br>    iii) Do what is fastest U Key or Die<br> <strong class="text-strong"> d) Map screen</strong><br>    i) Top left of screen<br>    ii) Squad spawn options.<br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline">4) Beacons</span><br> <strong class="text-strong"> a) Switching out squad leader</strong><br>    i) Sometimes, squad leaders are asked to redeploy first to a base in order to put a beacon; Don’t redeploy on that base if you’re not a squad leader, wait for the beacons to be up.<br>    ii) Request new squad lead, “Who can place beacon”<br>    iii) Setting up the “Squad Promote request” hotkey, Initially not assigned to anything<br>  <strong class="text-strong">b) Call when beacon is up/dies</strong><br>  <strong class="text-strong">c) Spend the least amount of time to put the beacon in the best position</strong><br>    i) No more than 5-10 Seconds<br>    ii) Behind a wall or a box<br>    iii) Out of easy line of sight from the enemy<br>    iv) When on point hold use the roof stairs<br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline">5) General awareness</span><br>  <strong class="text-strong">a) Use of minimap to know where the main attack is coming from. </strong><br>    i) Infantry, Max’s and Galaxy Drops<br>    ii) The minimap allows you to spot a target or a threat<br>  <strong class="text-strong">b) Knowing the most commons building in the game and their safe spots</strong><br> <strong class="text-strong"> c) Knowing how to break in a room as safely as possible</strong><br>    i) Push into a point room and stick to the walls, don't run straight in.<br>    ii) Try to take out the greatest threat first, Turret , Max Etc<br>    iii) Spot the places where an enemy could be (look for crates, pillars, etc…)<br>    iv) Medics throw a revive grenade at the door entrance as we push the point too pick up the first fallen.<br>    v) Prior to the push, throw some grenade  in first<br>  <strong class="text-strong">d) How to position yourself in order to survive or to hold a position</strong><br>    i) Be in a spot where the enemy comes from as few places as possible<br>  <strong class="text-strong">e) How to recognise a safespot, how to recognise a potential danger</strong><br>    i) If you see a dead body on the ground, just think that he died of something.
