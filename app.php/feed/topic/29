Ouuuh that sounds nice!<br>I will be up for that. Also, if you really need meanings of people which are not stepping back from their POV and change their oppinions easier than their underwear I can give you hard meanings from my side with any workarounds to tell it softly... nope, always just straight ahead <img class="smilies" src="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br><br>Just give it a go with writing. I will read it definitely <img class="smilies" src="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":)" title="Smile"> Also always good to have feedback! Without that it is really hard to see what people want or what is going on in other minds.<br><br>Let's spread the forum below each other and get more active. <br>I will probably write a bit stuff in the vehicle section. The weapons are for the comparison done, where I don't know what else to write with the nice work behind the link I posted.<br><br>So, see you later then again and let's write our stuff the next days and weeks <img class="smilies" src="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">lightpsycho</a> — Thu May 10, 2018 1:38 am</p><hr />
