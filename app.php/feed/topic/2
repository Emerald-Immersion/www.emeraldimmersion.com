The buffs primary focus on spammability from the hip, though some pistols received balances that held solidify their niche or differentiate them more from alternatives.<br><br>NS Pistols<br>NS-44L Blackhand<br><br>    Max damage range from 5m to 20m<br>    Equip time from 250ms to 450ms<br>    Hipfire CoF while standing and crouching from 2 to 1.75<br>    Hipfire CoF while walking and crouchwalking from 3 to 2.5<br><br>NS-44L Showdown<br><br>    Max damage range from 5m to 8m<br>    Refire rate while ADS from 500ms to 333ms<br><br>NS-44 Commissioner<br><br>    Equip time from 250ms to 450ms<br><br>NS-45 Pilot<br><br>    Hipfire CoF bloom from 0.2 to 0.15<br>    Hipfire CoF while standing or crouching from 1.25 to 1<br>    Hipfire CoF while walking or crouchwalking from 1.75 to 1.5<br>    Now has access to an extended magazine option that increases magazine size by 3.<br><br>NC Pistols<br>NC4 Mag-Shot<br><br>    Hipfire CoF bloom from 0.28 to 0.14<br>    Hipfire CoF while standing or crouching from 1.5 to 1.25<br>    Hipfire CoF while crouchwalking from 1.5 to 1.25<br><br>LA8 Rebel<br><br>    Hipfire CoF bloom from 0.36 to 0.18<br>    Hipfire CoF while walking or crouchwalking from 1.5 to 1.25<br>    ADS CoF while standing, crouching, walking, or crouchwalking from 0.3 to 0.1<br><br>LA3 Desperado<br><br>    Hipfire CoF bloom from 0.24 to 0.18<br>    Hipfire CoF while standing or crouching from 1.5 to to 1<br>    Hipfire CoF while walking or crouchwalking from 2 to 1.5<br><br>NC08 Mag-Scatter<br><br>    CoF bloom from 0.5 to 0<br>    Hipfire CoF while standing or crouching from 1.25 to 0.5<br>    Hipfire CoF while walking or crouchwalking from 1.75 to 1<br>    ADS CoF while standing or crouching from 0.1 to 0.5<br>    ADS CoF while walking or crouchwalking from 0.7 to 0.5<br>    Vertical recoil while ADS from 1 to 2<br>    Magscatter's Laser Sight attachment has been renamed the "MPL" and reduces hipfire pellet spread by -0.25<br><br>The Executive<br><br>    Hipfire CoF bloom from 0.28 to 0.14<br>    Hipfire CoF while walking or crouchwalking from 1.5 to 1.25<br><br>TR Pistols<br>TX1 Repeater<br><br>    Hipfire CoF while standing or crouching from 1.5 to 1<br>    Hipfire CoF while walking or crouchwalking from 2 to 1.5<br>    Hipfire maximum CoF from 7 to 2.5<br>    Removed the semi-auto firing mode<br><br>TX2 Emperor<br><br>    Hipfire CoF bloom from 0.24 to 0.12<br>    ADS CoF while standing, crouching, walking, or crouchwalking from 0.3 to 0.1<br><br>TS2 Inquisitor<br><br>    Hipfire CoF bloom from 0.2 to 0.15<br>    Hipfire CoF while walking or crouchwalking from 1.5 to 1.25<br><br>The President<br><br>    Hipfire CoF while standing or crouching from 1.5 to 1<br>    Hipfire CoF while walking or crouchwalking from 2 to 1.5<br>    Hipfire maximum CoF from 7 to 2.5<br>    Removed the semi-auto firing mode<br><br>VS Pistols<br>Beamer VS3<br><br>    Hipfire CoF bloom from 0.24 to 0.12<br><br>Manticore SX40<br><br>    Hipfire CoF bloom from 0.28 to 0.14<br>    Max damage range from 10m to 15m<br><br>Cerberus<br><br>    Hipfire CoF bloom from 0.36 to 0.18<br>    Hipfire CoF while walking or crouchwalking from 1.5 to 1.25<br><br>Spiker<br><br>    Hipfire bloom from 0.22 to 0.15<br>    ADS bloom from 0.11 to 0.1<br><br>The Immortal<br><br>    Hipfire CoF bloom from 0.24 to 0.12<br><br>Vehicle Adjustments<br>Galaxy<br><br>    Resistance type 12 (Flak Explosive) from -120 to -50<br><br>Dev Note: This increases kill time from a dual burster MAX from about 24 seconds to 36 seconds. For comparison, pre-CAI, the TTK of a burster max was roughly 38 seconds. An MBT/Harasser's Ranger versus the vehicle follows a similar pattern, from 26 seconds TTK to 39 seconds TTK.<br><br>Liberator<br><br>    Bottom armor from 50% to 20%<br>    Resistance type 12 (Flak Explosive) from -130 to -75<br><br>Dev Note: Not taking the belly armor into consideration, the new Flak resistance increases the Liberator's time to kill versus a dual burster MAX from roughly 15 seconds to 22 seconds. With the addition of default Afterburner, the vehicle's ability to get in and out of combat made it less necessary to lean on the belly armor as a defense mechanism. We've reeled in that benefit, from 50% to 20%, which also helps make air to air combat less tedious. Dalton shots to kill versus another Liberator's belly armor, for example, goes from a 9 shot kill to a 6 shot kill.<br><br>Valkyrie<br><br>    Resistance type 12 (Flak Explosive) from -126 to -100<br><br>Dev Note: Valkyrie is the vehicle most prone to keeping its belly armor facing a damage source, and most likely to break line of sight with threats due to the vehicle's agility. Even so, we wanted to give the vehicle a bit more breathing room in those close situations.<br><br>Misc. Changes, Fixes, and Additions<br><br>    Using "/squad create" will create a squad for you. You currently have access to Squad Beacons, but they will not work correctly until you have more than one person in your squad.<br>    Bastion Fleet Carrier's new model now has a collision mesh associated with it. (Meaning you can shoot at, and walk around on it agai... oh wait.)<br>    Continent Control no longer appears in the TAB menu while Warp Gates are unstable.<br>    Battle Rank icon descriptors now escalate every 10 Battle Ranks instead of each rank, this is only viewable on the death screen and My Character screen.<br>    Armistice and Hailstorm SMGs should once again use suppressed audio when a suppressor is equipped.<br>    Replaced the Implant Nav Menu icon with something more fitting.<br>    Getting within 10 meters of a Cortium vein should no longer create a hitch.<br>    Single Use Gold Camo's description is now more... descriptive.<br>    Blackhand and Holiday sidearms now count as a Sidearm for the purposes of directives and implant usage.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=49">MrKoronas</a> — Fri Apr 06, 2018 1:52 pm</p><hr />
