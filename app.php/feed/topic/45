Hello people i am Madira. formerly known as Felkuro.<br><br>I joined planetside 2 when it was still in beta. and joined Deathwatch gaming 2 days after the live release. I stopped playing with deathwatch due to heay inactivity. And switched to the TR side with "INI elite" due to an invitation. I stopped completly in 2014 when my account got hacked. And now in 2018 i am back to make my mark again with another outfit.<br><br>I am an experienced FPS player with a mindset that focuses on teamplay and tactics.  I also don't mind leading aslong as i have a few beers in me. (better judgement yadda yadda)<br><br>I got a very good first impressions today. And i can definitly see myself moving forward in this oufit.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=91">Madira</a> — Tue Jul 17, 2018 8:35 pm</p><hr />
