That is sad to hear.I always enjoyed your lead in-game also outside of the game.<br>I have been with the EDIM for a short amount of time but i can easily say your presence in the ts and the squad makes a lot of positive difference.<br>I personally thank you for your effort and leadership.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=73">Prometheus</a> — Wed May 30, 2018 8:20 pm</p><hr />

Hello folks.<br>In this thread I need to announce that I am going to step back from the leadership team.<br>There is a lot I could write about but at the end the people who are maybe or maybe not interested already know about it and the rest is probably not interersted anyways.<br>Finally I can say: My work is done also if the most people will never know what I did.<br><br>I will stay as "Immersed" rank and join the platoons from time to time or take over a squad if needed. Maybe, if I have the time or feel like, I will come around with a public squad or platoon or we see a bit vehicle operation which I do lately as most (sadly) but I won't be anybody who is telling somebody else what to do in the outfit anymore.<br>After the 3rd of June, on which the next officers meeting should happen, I want to be demoted on request.<br><br>This is my decision and definitely the best choice for Emerald Immersion as an outfit.<br><br>I thank you for being with us and hope you have as much fun as you can have together.<br>Take care everybody!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">lightpsycho</a> — Sun May 27, 2018 10:44 pm</p><hr />
