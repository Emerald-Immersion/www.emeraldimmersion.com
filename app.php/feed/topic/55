Because I don't have any real mean to contact the EDIM officers, I'll do it here :<br><br>I might not be on very often for the next two weeks. I just started engineering studies in a new university, and they are organising a lot of stuff for the new students, including a lot of parties during the evenings. I don't know when I will be on, and I don't when I will be able to do a training session. But I will still try to do one. I just wanted to inform you.<br>While I'm not really someone that enjoy parties, as part as a new community, I think that I have to participate in these events, that's why I'm doing it. But yeah, you won't see me very often until Septemeber 17th let's say.<br><br>Anyway, have fun playing PS2, I'll try to be there as often as possible :p<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=81">Axil | varmik</a> â€” Wed Sep 05, 2018 11:26 am</p><hr />
