<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Whats a good, easy to prepare meal for one person?</div></blockquote>During university. I lived alone, took care of my english bulldog. I will tell you the ultimate food source.<br>You will need oven, fridge and microwave.<br><br>Just get shit ton of potatos, carrots, beans, &lt;insert meat of your choice&gt; (sliced chicken/meatballs/thin red meat), onions. Slice them nicely. put them all on the large plate that comes with the oven. Spray some spices and push it in to the oven at 180C.<br><br>Extra : add tomato sauce on it and cover with aluminium foil.<br><br>Wait 1.5 hours and bam .. food. Make it large enough that it lasts you an entire week. I dont care what anyone else will say but as long as you keep it in the fridge that shit will not spoil. Maybe dry up a little bit but microwave will help reverse that.<br><br>30 minutes to prepare, 5 minutes to clean up. Food for 1 week.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Davelantor</a> — Wed Apr 11, 2018 6:27 am</p><hr />

ASP no imo, since it is too new and the history of DBG will probably let them change it again somehow more or less... I would wait. Luckily I am not 120 yet - I know only BR100 is needed but I want to have the titles of BR120, so I will raise the oldschool way and look into it probably later.<br>ASP yes imoo, because of the benefits you can have using it for leadership!<br><br>I repeate the first question which was questiones here: Shitpost is okay, or not?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">lightpsycho</a> — Tue Apr 10, 2018 4:45 pm</p><hr />
