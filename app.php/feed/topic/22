Stuff to say about it:<br><br>You need to claim the 500 DBC/month or they just will be vanished not claimed until the next day of new given DBC. (date is shown)<br><br>As far as I know it is 5% Squad XP Boost, stacking<br><br>The daily certs are rasing per hour - so, 2 certs/hour, stacking up to 48 you will receive but not higher. Logging in twice a day is recommended but not needed. If you time it every evening at the same minute it is doable without 'losing' certs in nowhere. (Sad about being in holidays and nobody logging in for you)<br><br>You receive 2 more character slots which means having 5 character slots which could be filled with 5 characters (every char gets the 48 certs/day means you need to login on every char every day to have the benefits)<br>The 2 character slots are handled as bought and will stay also if you cancle membership.<br><br>you receive 3 more loadout slots - these 3 slots will be vanished once you let membership run out. you won't keep then and get back to 4 loadout slots.<br><br>The discounts can be found in the last tab in the menue. Just look at the daily and membersale and it shows you how much you could save with membership additional at the daily sale. (Only in DBC which you get 500 from every month<br><br>ASP... well... <img class="smilies" src="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Are you sure about the rank for squads? It tends to be weird not not following always the logics...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">lightpsycho</a> — Tue Apr 10, 2018 4:56 pm</p><hr />
