"[...]we'd like to add the ability to leave chat channels[...]" yay, more for soloplayers and their wasted ressources! I wonder how many of them will just instantly leave the leaderchat. Good work daybreak! We need want more battlefield feeling and "farming" to stay away of the game much earlier <img class="smilies" src="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":)" title="Smile"><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">lightpsycho</a> — Sun Aug 26, 2018 3:27 pm</p><hr />

But they took the last bit of difference for the magrider. Not that the prowler and vanguard would just rush through a maggy in seconds if you don't have the experience and knowledge while a random user is on the opposite site, no, now they are getting buffed again. Well, maybe this is giving me more a feeling of not being bored the most time in a maggy... lol<br><br>orders channel removement was announced 3 patches ago already.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">lightpsycho</a> — Thu Aug 16, 2018 9:00 pm</p><hr />

A LOT of changes in this update, and many of them without prior PTS testing apparently.<br>Many of these new implants have a lot of potential, some may even be highly mandatory (Bionics looks amazing for engineers, Fortify might be a gamechanger for drops on points).<br><br>Negative: they removed the Orders channel, for no discernable reason it seems. No real alternative, effectively crippling faction coordination ingame.<br><br>Slight HESH nerf and AP buff, and finally tank guns will kill Flak armour infanty on a direct hit. Nothing quite so tilting as hitting a HA to the face with an FPC and not getting a kill.<br><br>The implant crafting system will be largely irrelevant for seasoned players, most of the interesting ones are exceptionals and cannot be crafted, the rest will be gotten simply through alerts.<br><br>Looking forward to seeing these *ahem* "code improvements" in practice.<br><br><br>Fyi:<br><a href="https://i.imgur.com/tMzrdR3.png" class="postlink">https://i.imgur.com/tMzrdR3.png</a><br><br>New implant drop rates. TL;DR: ISO4-Recyclers all the way to obtain the exceptional/uncommon ones asap.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=103">Mardevian</a> — Thu Aug 16, 2018 3:05 pm</p><hr />
