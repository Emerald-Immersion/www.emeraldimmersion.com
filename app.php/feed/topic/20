Hey there Emerald Immersion,<br><br>like announced a bit in the last 2 weeks I have something I want to share with you. This is the only available weapons overview available for Planetside 2 and it is not only that, it is good looking and - what else to expect - a community driven project of one of my mates from Planetside 2.<br>The credits here go to iWinHD from [CABO] and he knows who else worked on it as well, if somebody needs to know.<br><br><a href="http://ps2tools.tmweb.ru/" class="postlink">http://ps2tools.tmweb.ru/</a><br><br>Here you will be able to find information about the weapons and everything you maybe cant find or compare in the game.<br>This project is into BETA (shouldn't be ALPHA anymore at least) and there is stuff on which should be worked on; so, if you find stuff which is maybe not working correctly or you are not sure about its correct working, write it as best below that topic here and let me know. I will look into it as official BETA tester and let iWinHD know about it once I localised the problem.<br><br>Alright, see you around!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">lightpsycho</a> — Mon Apr 09, 2018 12:08 pm</p><hr />
