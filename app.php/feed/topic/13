Well, i guess it's time for me to write one of these introductions as well, so here goes...<br><br>I've been playing Planetside 2 for quite a while now with multiple breaks in between. The vast majority of my playtime has been accumulated on my Vanu Character and you can very rarely see me playing other factions.<br><br>I enjoy flying Galaxies but mainly stick to playing Infantry. The classes i play heavily depend on my mood that day, but i mainly play Heavy Assault/Combat Medic/Engineer during squad/platoon play.<br><br>Mentioning squad and platoon play: I've been leading squads for a good amount of time now, and (not so recently anymore i guess) started doing platoons as well. Personally i feel like i'm better at squad management, but i don't mind being that guy screwing up the continent with attacking wrong bases.<br><br>[REDACTED]<br><br>See you guys on the battlefield and Papa Vanu bless,<br><br>Pronix<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Pronix</a> — Sat Apr 07, 2018 12:36 pm</p><hr />
