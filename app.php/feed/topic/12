Alright, took ages but here I am.<br><br>I come as classical singer definitely of a part of music where you know what is going on and how music works and stuff. Mostly you have much more experience and can listen a lot better than the standard user. From that side and also with a lot more stuff like text and correctness and so on there is much on the world I dislike, much I can hear while doing workouts or work but what I would not get running to just listen to it.<br><br>A funny part in classical music is, that the same time a lot of classical  musicians listen to metal. This might be - imo - due to the impressive work with differences in music and, surely not always and in every band, hte fucking awesome use of tempi, intonation, timings, change of time (idk how its really called in english, didn't directly find it), rhythms, rhythm changes and so on. Looking e.g. at Carmina Burana from Carl Orff yuo can take that as the classical music some bands do in metal. Lots of not so easy changes just in the piece of music and they are all just musically correct.<br><br>Well, beside of that I am some times addicted to hard-/emocore like Silverstein, Aiden, Days in Grief... idk, sort of that and surely Punk up to punkrock. That fits to my sentences abuot the game and in yellk chat combined with my thinking, right? <img class="smilies" src="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";)" title="Wink"> It is a higher level than the standard user of whereever from the world who is just doing some shit without reflecting or questioning it.<br><br>Well, there is a lot I could say about music but this is so far the first step I would go for now. If you want or need to know what I mean just tell me and I will try to give some examples <img class="smilies" src="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">lightpsycho</a> — Sun Apr 29, 2018 11:00 am</p><hr />

For me it depends on the situation. If i am consistantly getting killed and i am angry i will listen to angry music to calm me down. If it is a rare session where i am not being killed every second i will listen to anything. The angry music i listen to will be some form of metal otherwise it is just anything rock.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=50">Prephem</a> — Sat Apr 07, 2018 1:04 pm</p><hr />
