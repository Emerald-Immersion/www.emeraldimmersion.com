Heya, I'm Blitz, short for <strong class="text-strong">BlitzEMP</strong> (IGN)<br>I am from London, UK but I am also Syrian.<br><br>I started playing Planetside 2 back in September 2012 when the game was made live. I had initially started of with characters in Briggs as it had the lowest population because I had such a potato of a PC and I really wanted to play the game as it was something so different to many of the big FPS shooters out there. I really loved the game however the potato graphics and low fps made me play the game for about a year and I had lost interest. I would say I was lost in where to put my certs and had so much issues with my pc, that obviously lead to me leaving the game until late 2013. <br>At that time I had got a better PC which allowed me to play on miller with better graphics. I was on and off the game until September 2017 when I joined MrKoronas's platoon. His leading alongside the squad leaders made me love planetside again. I then later joined EDIM a day after.<br><br>Here I am now, holding the rank Lieutenant in the outfit. I really love leading squads and helping out in the platoons and I still to this day love what EDIM is doing. My goal this year is to start platoon leading more often as I think it would help the growth of EDIM which is what I truly want, but also because its really fun seeing how everyone listens to orders. All it takes is a mic and cooperation I guess  <img class="smilies" src="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br><br>Signing off,<br>BlitzEMP<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">BlitzEMP</a> — Sat Apr 07, 2018 6:47 pm</p><hr />
