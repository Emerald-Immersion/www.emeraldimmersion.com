For the short version go <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=40" class="postlink">[HERE]</a><br><br>Hello Outfit Members,<br><br>since the topic has been brought up quite often recently, i thought i'd make a forum post about it.<br><br>This guide will explain the best loadout for each squad when focusing on Squad/Teamplay. Reasoning as to why each loadout piece is chosen will be provided as small comments. After the breakdown of the specific loadout i will go a little bit more in depth about of how to play the class and what role it should fill during the Squad/Teamplay. <br><br>However, keep in mind that everybody plays differently and develops a different playstyle with more experience, so view this more as a guideline than a rule that applies 100% of the time. Additionally, different situations require different approaches. To keep it simple, each loadout will be optimized for a point hold indoors, which is the most common situation we will find ourselves in. <br><br>If you have any ideas, suggestions or question, post them either below or catch me on teamspeak and we will talk about it.<br>Without anymore text though, lets jump straight in.<br><br><br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gfzqurJ.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Weapons</span></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline">Primary</span><br><br>A Weapon you feel confident playing with. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Generally SMGs are the best choice, if you're good at close quarter sniping equip the ghost.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline">Secondary</span><br><br>A Sidearm you feel confident playing with. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">The NS Commissioner and the NS Underboss are the most used sidearms due to the high damage output per shot.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline">Tool</span><br><br>Motion Spotter. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">While the Recon Detective Device is more spammable, the motion spotter stays up as long as it doesn't get destroyed, whereas sensor darts expire after a short time frame.

His job is to spot enemies and hack terminals to pull vehicles when asked. The Infiltrator can also flank enemies, taking out a few of them before returning to safety. Usually it is advised that he doesn't stay inside the building but rather roams around the base. The downside of this playstyle is that he can not get revived once he dies, making it a more difficult class to play efficiently together with the rest of the squad.<br>It is advised to have only one Infiltrator in each Squad.</li></ul><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UkdEuPo.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Weapons</span></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline">Primary</span><br><br>A Weapon you feel confident playing with. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Carbines are usually better options than both SMGs and Shotguns, however shotguns can be very efficient in very close quarter combat</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline">Secondary</span><br><br>A Sidearm you feel confident playing with. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">The NS Commissioner and the NS Underboss are the most used sidearms due to the high damage output per shot.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline">Tool</span><br><br>Rocklet Rifle. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Typhoon Rocklets can be very useful when taking out Sunderers or other armor, on the other side they decrease the Anti Air capability of the Rocklet Rifle</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Ability slot</span></span><br><br>Skirmisher Jumpjets. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Skirmisher Jumpjets are personally my favourite, because they allow for more mobility than the Drifter Jumpjets or Ambusher Jumpjets. Other players can make great use of the Ambusher Jumpjets however, so it comes down to personal preference and playstyle again.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Suit Slot</span></span><br><br>Nanoweave Armor/Advanced Shield Capacitor. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Both are great options for the Light Assault. Additional Grenades can be helpful as well, but in my opinion survivability is more important, due to the way Light Assaults work together with the Squad.<br></span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Grenade Slot</span></span><br><br>Frag Grenade/Flash Grenade. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Both are useful, the Flash Grenade usually is the most efficient when breaching a point, whereas the Frag Grenade is most useful during the defense of a point.<br></span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Utility Slot</span></span><br><br>C4. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">C4 is a great way to get rid of clusters of enemies, MAX Units or when taking out Sunderers or enemy armor, which is very helpful during Squad/Teamplay and makes the Light Assault a very good aggressor.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Implants</span></span><br><br>Catlike + Regeneration. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Regeneration once again helps with survivability, while Catlike allows for even more mobility, the greatest strength of Light Assaults. This is, in my opinion, the strongest combo, however these are just suggestion so use whatever you're comfortable with or have unlocked.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Class Role during Squad/Teamplay</span></span><br><ul><li>The Light Assault acts as a scout and flank unit during Squad/Teamplay. It's mobility is great for flanking enemies and distracting them from pushing. The Flash grenade is a great tool to use when breaching rooms, as it completly blinds the enemies inside. Additionally Light Assaults are great to quickly destroy enemy deployed sunderers, due to it's anit armor capabilities. Like the Infiltator, Light Assaults usually roam around the base, which makes it difficult to play efficiently with the rest of the Squad. As the Light Assault usually can not get revived by the medics, some experience is required to get the most out of the class when capturing bases.<br>It is advised to only have one Light Assault in each Squad.</li></ul><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QX3gBBd.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Weapons</span></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline">Primary</span><br><br>A Weapon you feel confident playing with. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Assault Rifles are usually the best choice since they are good in close quarter combat, as well as in medium ranged combat</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline">Secondary</span><br><br>A Sidearm you feel confident playing with. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">The NS Commissioner and the NS Underboss are the most used sidearms due to the high damage output per shot.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline">Tool</span><br><br>Medical Applicator. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">No other choice, max it out as quick as you can, it's your medics best friend!</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Ability slot</span></span><br><br>Nano Regen Device. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">The Nano Regen Device enables you to heal yourself and allies in close proximity to you, making it very strong during point holds and breaches</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Suit Slot</span></span><br><br>Flak Armor. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Flak Armor is a great way to survive grenade spam, the possibly biggest threat to a point hold. If you don't die to the enemy grenades, you can keep the other Squad members up and running! Grenade Bandolier is a great choice as well, however one revive grenade should be sufficient enough when timed correctly and organized with the other medics.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Grenade Slot</span></span><br><br>Revive Grenade. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Don't even think about anything else in there, revives are important!</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Utility Slot</span></span><br><br>C4. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">C4 is a great way to get rid of clusters of enemies, MAX Units or when taking out Sunderers.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Implants</span></span><br><br>Combat Surgeon + Carapace/Ocular Shield. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Combat Surgeon is very strong (especially in combination with Carapace). Ocular Shield decreases the effect of concussion/flash grenades, which is especially helpful during point holds.

Their goal is to keep the squad alive and on full health. Medics should under no circumstances lead a push, but stay back and revive the fallen squadmembers. While reviving/healing is your primary objective, keep in mind that you want yourself to stay alive. Before reviving, make sure the threat is dead/gone and then continue to revive. The minimap/friendly callouts are the medics best friend for locating dead Squadmembers.<br>It is advised to have 3+ Medics in each Squad.</li></ul><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ki0XCnw.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Weapons</span></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline">Primary</span><br><br>A Weapon you feel confident playing with. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Carbines are probably the best options, but Shotguns can be very useful in close quarter combat situations.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline">Secondary</span><br><br>A Sidearm you feel confident playing with. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">The NS Commissioner and the NS Underboss are the most used sidearms due to the high damage output per shot.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline">Tool</span><br><br>Nano-Armor Kit. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">No other choice, max it out as quick as you can, it's your engineers best friend!</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Ability slot</span></span><br><br>Anti Infantry MANA Turret. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">The Anti Infantry MANA Turret is a great way to lock down doors, provide cover and mow down enemies.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Suit Slot</span></span><br><br>Flak Armor. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Flak Armor allows you to survive grenade spam, possibly the greatest threat to point holds. However the Grenade Bandolier or Advanced Shield Capacitor can be useful too. Equip whatever you feel the most confident with.</span></em></li> </ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Grenade Slot</span></span><br><br>Sticky Grenade/Frag Grenade. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Sticky Grenades are a great way to kill off MAX Units and their pocket engineers. However be careful when throwing them around friendlies, as you can easily wipe a corridor by accident!</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Utility Slot</span></span><br><br>Reserve Hardlight Barrier. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">The Reserver Hardlight Barrier is a great way to provide even more cover for friendlies, which increases the survivability for the whole squad immensely. Keep in mind that it costs nanites, just like your grenades.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Implants</span></span><br><br>Robotics Technicna + Ocular Shield. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Robotics Technician applies a resistance to your deployables, making it harder to destroy them. Ocular Shield decreases the effectiveness of concussion/flash grenades, making it very strong during point holds. However these are just suggestion so use whatever you are comfortable with or have unlocked.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Class Role during Squad/Teamplay</span></span><br><ul><li>The Engineer is the second support role for the squad. Not only does he provide ammo, but he also deploys cover, while being an active shooter himself. The Anti Infantry MANA Turret is a great way to keep entrances locked down while providing cover at the same time. Multiple engineers can place their Turrets side by side, creating a turret wall that is very difficult to take down. When MAX Units are being pulled for the point hold or breach, it is the engineers job to keep the MAX Units repaired and running. Keep yourself save though, as a dead engineeer can not repair a MAX Unit. It is always the better option to have the MAX Unit come back to be repaired, instead of the engineer following the MAX into the enemy fireline (this does not apply to point breaches).<br>It is advised to have 1+ Engineers in each Squad.</li></ul><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nwSgdZL.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"> <br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Weapons</span></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline">Primary</span><br><br>A Weapon you feel confident playing with. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">LMGs are very powerful weapons and usually the best choice. However, Lashers are known to be very efficient when locking down entrances to a building, increasing their effectiveness the more Lashers there are. Usually Heavy Assaults will be asked to bring the Lasher, if not he is free to bring whatever he is most confident with.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline">Secondary</span><br><br>A Sidearm you feel confident playing with. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">The NS Commissioner and the NS Underboss are the most used sidearms due to the high damage output per shot.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline">Tool</span><br><br>Nemesis VSH9/NS Annihilator. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">It is important for the Heavy Assault to bring in Anti Air Lock on Laucnhers, are ESFs (Empire Specific Fighters) can be a huge threat to both a push and point hold. While usually not killing the Aircraft, Lock ons ensure the ESF being deterred and keeping their distance, making them less deadly.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Ability slot</span></span><br><br>Resist Shield. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Personally i believe it's the best shield during Squad/Teamplay as the energy does not get drained when shot at, but rather deflects part of the incoming damage. Combine that with a Combat Medic healing the Heavy Assault and you got a tank that is able to stand a lot of damge.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Suit Slot</span></span><br><br>Flak Armor/Grenade Bandolier. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Once again, Flak Armor increases your survivability immensely during grenade spam periods. However, more concussion grenades allow for more situations where they can be used to delay enemy pushes or their reactiveness to the Squad's push. A good mix between Flak Armor and Grenade Bandolier heavies should be ensured to increase efficiency of the Squad.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Grenade Slot</span></span><br><br>Concussion Grenades. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Often referred to as 'Conclusion Grenades', they are very strong when breaching a point room and when defending a point room, often concluding the fight nice and easy by ensuring the victory.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Utility Slot</span></span><br><br>C4. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">C4 is a great way to get rid of clusters of enemies, MAX Units or when taking out Sunderers.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Implants</span></span><br><br>Battle Hardened/Assimilate + Ocular Shield. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Ocular Shield is very good during point holds by decreasing the effects of concusion/flash grenades while Battle Hardened allows for easier shooting. Assimilate grants parts of your personal shield back upon killing enemies with a headshot, which is usually the most efficient if you have good aim and often get headshot kills. However these are just suggestion so use whatever you are comfortable with or have unlocked.</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Class Role during Squad/Teamplay</span></span><br><ul><li>The Heavy Assault is the tank and shooter of the Squad. Designed to soak up enemy damage they lead a push into the point room, or ensure the enemies stay outside by peeking doors and landing shots on enemies. When playing the Heavy Assault, it is important to keep the rest of your squad safe. Heavy Assaults are most likely to die, due to being the meatshields and damage soakers of the Squad. If you are playing the Heavy Assault, prepare to die for your Squad, but be ensured that you will most likely be picked up again by your friendly neighbourhood medic.<br>It is advised to have 3+ Heavy Assaults in each squad.</li></ul><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9seefrm.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Weapons</span></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline">Primary</span><br><br>Two Weapon you feel confident playing with. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">Anti Infantry weapons are obviously the best choice when defending a point, however the NS Bursters are a great way to deter enemy aircrafts</span></em></li></ul><span style="text-decoration:underline">Secondary</span><br><br>N/A<br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline">Tool</span><br><br>N/A<br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Ability slot</span></span><br><br>Zealot Overdrive. <ul><li><em class="text-italics"><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">ZOE MAX Units are great damage dealers, however die more quickly due to taking more damage.

While surviving a lot of damage, they aditionally can deal great amounts damage using their two arm mounted weapons. The downside to MAX Units is that they are slower, take a longer time to revive and cost 450 nanties, which is a huge investment.
