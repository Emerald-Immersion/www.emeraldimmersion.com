Hello people i am Madira. formerly known as Felkuro.<br><br>I joined planetside 2 when it was still in beta. and joined Deathwatch gaming 2 days after the live release. I stopped playing with deathwatch due to heay inactivity. And switched to the TR side with "INI elite" due to an invitation. I stopped completly in 2014 when my account got hacked. And now in 2018 i am back to make my mark again with another outfit.<br><br>I am an experienced FPS player with a mindset that focuses on teamplay and tactics.  I also don't mind leading aslong as i have a few beers in me. (better judgement yadda yadda)<br><br>I got a very good first impressions today. And i can definitly see myself moving forward in this oufit.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=91">Madira</a> — Tue Jul 17, 2018 8:35 pm</p><hr />

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>This is when I thought about the "imparfait" xD I wanted to take a past but which.... and I decided somehow for the imparfait <img class="smilies" src="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> I looked rn for it in wikipedia and I think I know why it should be Passé composé but thinking about it Imperfait wouldn't be wrong... for me it would depend on the point of view xD</div></blockquote>Imparfait and passé composé can be used to replace each other, without changing the sentence meaning, French are just used to hear one or the other in certain situations, or to put an accent on certain details in the sentence<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Sure, peu de ... how can I use a form of pouvoir for peu de?`Lack of using it.. xD</div></blockquote> You already used your conjugation of "pouvoir" at the beginning of the sentence<blockquote class="uncited"><div>je pense que <span style="color:#FF8040">je peux</span> utiliser</div></blockquote>There is a difference between "peux" (from pouvoir) and "peu" (which mean few), here "peu de" was for "few of", it was just a orthography mistake ("peu" is an "invariable")<br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>is croire like -s, -s, -x in singular? I really forgot that :S mixed it probably with something else <img class="smilies" src="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div></blockquote>"Je crois, tu crois, il croit"<br>"Croix" with the "x" means "Cross" and isn't a verb<br><br><br>This post is tranforming into a "Cours de français" XD<br>But that isn't bad, gets me to learn things back (yeah, as every french, conjugations are forgotten for years, we need to learn them back from the web)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://www.emeraldimmersion.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=56">Yume</a> — Sun Apr 08, 2018 9:30 am</p><hr />
